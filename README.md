U Hack It!
==========

An interactive tutorial on website security issues - a hackable website deployed on hack.me

-------------------------------------------

   The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how poor web programming practices
   expose serious security vulnerabilities to would-be hackers.  
  
   Thus, this code should NOT, under any circumstance, be used on a real website.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
 1) Copy package to webserver docroot;
    - webserver must have read/write access so SQLite DB can be created
    - all tables are created by app as required.

 2) If you are using .htaccess mod_rewrite, you can (optionally) use clean URL's setting in app-init.php
    Otherwise, ensure CLEAN_URLS is FALSE in app-init.php (default setting for use on hack.me).

 3) Install the app in htdocs, and point your browser at index.php


DEVELOPMENT:
------------
Code is available at: https://github.com/powderflask/u-hack-it

Contributions welcome on following conditions:
 - this is a BASIC tutorial - examples should be aimed at students just learning about web development
 - each exploit is a simple lesson that allows student to exploit an intentional vulnerability - these are not challenges, they are lessons!
 - just because the coding is intentially sloppy doesn't mean the code itself should be!
 
How to build a new exploit:
 - add a new "template" to the exploits folder to describe the exploit and how to peform the hack
 - add a exploit item in app-init.php
 - any new php files should be added to app/ folder
